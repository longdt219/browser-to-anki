Three key components need to be addressed:

1. Interacting with a user's deck collection
2. Performing useful dictionary lookups
3. The browser-based frontend.

Regarding 1:
	- We can avoid dealing with authentication on behalf of the user by just
	interacting with the local deck in python. This is probably the easiest
	starting point.
	- We could reverse engineer ankiweb.net
	- We could investigate how the desktop client does this.

Regarding 2:
	- We can do langid of text and choose appropriate dictionaries. As a
	  starting point, probably just worth focusing on getting one dictionary
	  working.

Regarding 3:
	- The current idea for the workflow is: click or highlight a word, then a
	  popup occurs with various definitions that have been fetched. The user
	  chooses the relevant one and then adds a card. The context for the card
	  is automatically determined.
